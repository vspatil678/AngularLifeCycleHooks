After creating a component/directive by calling its constructor, 
Angular calls the lifecycle hook methods in the following sequence at specific moments:

1-- ngOnChanges()
    Respond when Angular (re)sets data-bound input properties.
    The method receives a SimpleChanges object of current and previous property values.
    Called before ngOnInit() and whenever one or more data-bound input properties change.
    
2--  ngOnInit()
    Called once, after the first ngOnChanges().
    Initialize the directive/component after Angular first displays the data-bound properties
    and sets the directive/component's input properties.
    
3-- ngDoCheck()
    Detect and act upon changes that Angular can't or won't detect on its own.
    Called during every change detection run, immediately after ngOnChanges() and ngOnInit().
    
4-- ngAfterContentInit()
    Respond after Angular projects external content into the component's view / the view that a directive is in.
    Called once after the first ngDoCheck().
    
5-- ngAfterContentChecked()
    Respond after Angular checks the content projected into the directive/component.
    Called after the ngAfterContentInit() and every subsequent ngDoCheck().
    
6-- ngAfterViewInit()
    Respond after Angular initializes the component's views and child views / the view that a directive is in.
    Called once after the first ngAfterContentChecked().
    
7-- ngAfterViewChecked()
    Respond after Angular checks the component's views and child views / the view that a directive is in.
    Called after the ngAfterViewInit() and every subsequent ngAfterContentChecked().
    
8-- ngOnDestroy()
    Cleanup just before Angular destroys the directive/component. 
    Unsubscribe Observables and detach event handlers to avoid memory leaks.
    Called just before Angular destroys the directive/component.
    

USAGE
--------------
constructor
Don't fetch data in a component constructor. 
Constructors should do no more than set the initial local variables to simple values.
An ngOnInit() is a good place for a component to fetch its initial data.

Use ngOnInit() for two main reasons:
  1-To perform complex initializations shortly after construction.
  2- To set up the component after Angular sets the input properties.
  Remember also that a directive's data-bound input properties are not set until after construction.
  That's a problem if you need to initialize the directive based on those properties. They'll have been set when ngOnInit() runs.
  The ngOnChanges() method is your first opportunity to access those properties.
  Angular calls ngOnChanges() before ngOnInit() and many times after that. It only calls ngOnInit() once.
  
  
 OnDestroy()
  Put cleanup logic in ngOnDestroy(), the logic that must run before Angular destroys the directive.
  This is the place to free resources that won't be garbage collected automatically.
  Unsubscribe from Observables and DOM events.
  Stop interval timers. Unregister all callbacks that this directive registered with global or application services.
  You risk memory leaks if you neglect to do so.
 
 OnChanges()
   Angular calls its ngOnChanges() method whenever it detects changes to input properties of the component (or directive).
   
   ngOnChanges(changes: SimpleChanges) {
  for (let propName in changes) {
    let chng = changes[propName];
    let cur  = JSON.stringify(chng.currentValue);
    let prev = JSON.stringify(chng.previousValue);
    this.changeLog.push(`${propName}: currentValue = ${cur}, previousValue = ${prev}`);
  }
}

The ngOnChanges() method takes an object that maps each changed property name to a SimpleChange object
holding the current and previous property values. This hook iterates over the changed properties and logs them.

Angular only calls the hook when the value of the input property changes.

SimpleChange
SimpleChange is a class

class SimpleChange {
  constructor(previousValue: any, currentValue: any, firstChange: boolean)
  previousValue: any
  currentValue: any
  firstChange: boolean
  isFirstChange(): boolean
}

DoCheck()
  Use the DoCheck hook to detect and act upon changes that Angular doesn't catch on its own.
  Use this method to detect a change that Angular overlooked.
  This hook is called with enormous frequencyâ€”after every change detection cycle no matter where the change occurred.


AfterView()
  The AfterView sample explores the AfterViewInit() and AfterViewChecked() hooks
  that Angular calls after it creates a component's child views.
  
AfterContent() 
  The AfterContent sample explores the AfterContentInit() and AfterContentChecked() hooks that
  Angular calls after Angular projects external content into the component.
  Content projection is a way to import HTML content from outside the component and insert that content into the 
  component's template in a designated spot.
